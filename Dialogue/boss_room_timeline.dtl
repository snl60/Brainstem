eli_beacon_ryder: Finally, I've made it. The door to Ember's lair. It's about time we settle this.
dr_maddison: Excellent work, Beacon! You've navigated the maze of plasma enemies, collected the upgrades, and now you stand at the threshold of your toughest challenge yet.
eli_beacon_ryder: Yeah, I've got to admit, this journey's been one heck of a ride. But I'm ready. Ember won't know what hit him.
dr_maddison: Remember, Ember is a formidable foe. Use every skill and upgrade you've acquired. This battle will test your limits like never before. Your arm cannon may be able to wear down his energy reserves.
eli_beacon_ryder: I've got my electric imbuement, double jump, and slide. I've even fortified my armor. I'm more than ready to face this fiery adversary.
dr_maddison: Indeed. Your determination and preparation have brought you this far. Now, it’s time to show Ember the strength of the Beacon.
eli_beacon_ryder: Let’s do this. For all the struggles, for all the upgrades, for all the challenges... it's all led to this moment. Ember, here I come!
dr_maddison: Go forth with confidence, Beacon. The fate of our mission rests in your hands. Show Ember the true power of resilience and ingenuity.
system: CONGRATULATIONS! YOU HAVE REACHED THE END OF THE LEVEL. THE BOSS FIGHT AGAINST EMBER WILL BE ADDED IN FUTURE UPDATES.
