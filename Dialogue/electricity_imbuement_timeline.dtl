eli_beacon_ryder: Whoa, what do we have here? A shiny blue module thingy? Looks electrifying!
dr_maddison: Excellent, Beacon! That's the Electricity Imbuement module. Install it into your weapon immediately.
eli_beacon_ryder: You know, Doc, you should really label these things better. But hey, I'll take the power-up!
dr_maddison: Labels are for the weak-minded. Now, with this upgrade, your attacks will pack an electrifying punch! Plasma enemies won't know what hit them.
eli_beacon_ryder: Time to light 'em up! I always wanted to be a walking thunderstorm.
dr_maddison: Yes, yes, quite. Just be careful with the power surge. It's... potent.
eli_beacon_ryder: Potent? You mean awesome! Let's fry some circuits.
system: PRESS '1' ON KEYBOARD OR 'RB/R1' ON CONTROLLER TO SWITCH BETWEEN IMBUEMENTS
