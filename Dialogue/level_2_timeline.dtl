dr_maddison: Beacon, can you hear me?
eli_beacon_ryder: Dr. Maddison? It sounds like you're in my head!
dr_maddison: Technically, yes! I'm tapped into your neural device, communicating through your auditory brainstem implant. Fascinating, isn't it?
eli_beacon_ryder: My WHAT!?
dr_maddison: Never mind that. We have more important things to discuss. You've just entered a heavily fortified layer. Plasma-based enemies lurk about, waiting to roast you!
eli_beacon_ryder: Great, plasma enemies. Anything else on the menu?
dr_maddison: They're particularly vulnerable to the Electricity imbuement weapon upgrade. You must find it! Look for a... what was it... oh, a glowing blue module!
eli_beacon_ryder: Blue, got it. Anything else? Maybe a way to fly or something?
dr_maddison: Close! You'll need two more upgrades for your Quantum-Forge Armor\: a double jump and a slide. Both are essential to reach the upper levels of the fortress. Imagine the agility, the finesse!
eli_beacon_ryder: Quanta-what-now?
dr_maddison: Your Quantum-Forge Armor, of course! It's the exosuit that I gave you. Catchy name, ey?
eli_beacon_ryder: Sure, Doc. If you say so. 
eli_beacon_ryder: OK, double jump and slide upgrades for the Quanta-whats-it suit. Got it. Sounds like fun.
dr_maddison: That's the spirit! Now, listen carefully, Beacon. Your ultimate goal is to reach the upper levels and find Ember, the plasma overlord. Oh, such an exhilarating challenge!
eli_beacon_ryder: Ember, huh? Sounds like a hothead. Why do you keep calling me Beacon?
dr_maddison: Because, dear boy, you're the last beacon of hope in this tangled web of chaos humanity has stumbled into. Now, go forth and shine brilliantly!
eli_beacon_ryder: Geez... no pressure, huh? Alright, alright. Time to light up this joint. Wish me luck, Doc.
dr_maddison: Luck? Pfft, who needs luck when you have science! Got get 'em, Beacon!
